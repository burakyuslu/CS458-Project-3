The project is implemented in JavaScript using React.

Before running the project, go to the following directory:
```CS458-Project-3/cs458-project-3/```
and run the command:
```npm install```

Afterwards, you can start the project using the command:
```npm start```

All of the tests can be found in the following directory:
```CS458-Project-3/cs458-project-3/src/tests/```

The tests are implemented using Jest and React's testing library and there are many ways to run these tests. We chose to run the tests using the WebStorm IDE's built-in testing tools, which makes it easier to run the tests individually.
